Cognition is about using these models to understand the world, to explain, to imagine what could have happened that didn’t, or what could be true that isn’t, and then planning. prediction and explanation, is central to our view of human intelligence. pattern recognition can support model building, through “model-free” algorithms that learn through experience how to make essential inferences more computationally efficient What this article is not we believe that reverse engineering human intelligence can usefully inform AI and machine learning. avoiding cognitive or neural inspiration as well as claims of cognitive or neural plausibility is a approach to developing AI. But this article has little pertinence to this approach. Overview of the key ideas propose a set of core ingredients for building more human-like learning and thinking machines mainly in Section 4 Core ingredients of human intelligence Cognitive and neural inspiration in artificial intelligence behaviorist view Cognitive science PDP approach knowledge is thus distributed across the collection of units rather than localized as in most symbolic data structures. Neural network models and the PDP approach offer a view of the mind (and intelligence more broadly) that is sub-symbolic and often populated with minimal constraints and inductive biases to guide learning. Proponents of this approach maintain that many classic types of structured knowledge, such as graphs, grammars can be useful yet misleading metaphors for characterizing thought. Question neural networks have such broad application in machine vision, language, and control, and they can be trained to emulate the rule-like and structured behaviors that characterize cognition do we need more to develop truly human-like learning and thinking machines? How far can relatively generic neural networks bring us toward this goal? Challenges for building more human-like machines The Characters Challenge learning simple visual concepts People learn a lot more from a lot less, and capturing these human-level learning abilities in machines is the Characters Challenge Although humans and neural networks may perform equally well on the MNIST digit recognition task and other large-scale image classification tasks, it does not mean that they learn and think in the same way. two important differences between CNN and human in learning simple visual concepts people learn from fewer examples and they learn richer representations people learn more than how to do pattern recognition: they learn a concept, that is, a model of the class that allows their acquired knowledge to be flexibly applied in new ways. Some difficulty A single example of a new visual concept (red box) can be enough information to support the classification of new examples generation of new examples parsing an object into parts and relations generation of new concepts from related concepts. The Frostbite Challenge learning to play the Atari game Frostbite Failed on accomplishing a sub-goal (such as reaching an ice floe) and then safely proceed to the next sub-goal the policy are highly specialized for the games it was trained on considering the amount of experience required for learning non-professional humans can grasp the basics of the game after just a few minutes of play. people do this by inferring a general schema to describe the goals of the game and the object types and their interactions, using the kinds of intuitive theories, model-building abilities and model-based planning mechanisms we describe below. the game of Frostbite provides incremental rewards for reaching each active ice floe, providing the DQN with the relevant sub-goals for completing the larger task of building an igloo. Without these sub-goals, the DQN would have to take random actions until it accidentally builds an igloo and is rewarded for completing the entire level. Human is possible to figure out the higher-level goal of building an igloo without incremental feedback; sparse feedback is a source of difficulty in other Atari 2600 games such as Montezuma’s Revenge inflexible to changes in its inputs and goals. Changing the color or appearance of objects or changing the goals of the network would have devastating consequences on performance if the network is not retrained In contrast, people require little or no retraining or reconfiguration, adding new tasks and goals to their repertoire with relative ease. Humans as a result often have important domain-specific knowledge for these tasks, even before they ‘begin.’ The DQN is starting completely from scratch. How do we bring to bear rich prior knowledge to learn new tasks and solve new …","date":1679270400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1679270400,"objectID":"2f3eb87357daaf9b6e2c26b1090e73a2","permalink":"https://example.com/post/build-humanlike-machine/","publishdate":"2023-03-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/build-humanlike-machine/","section":"post","summary":"(1) build causal models of the world (2) ground learning in intuitive theories of physics and psychology (3) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn.
